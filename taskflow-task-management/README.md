# TaskFlow

TaskFlow is a lightweight and intuitive project management application inspired by Trello. It provides users with an easy-to-use interface to manage tasks, assign them to team members, set due dates, and visualize tasks on a calendar. TaskFlow is designed to help teams stay organized, manage workflows efficiently, and ensure timely completion of tasks.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Create tasks, assign them to specific team members, and move them across different stages of completion (`To Do`, `In Progress`, `Done`).
- **Drag and Drop Interface**: Organize tasks seamlessly by dragging and dropping them between columns.
- **Task Assignment**: Assign tasks to team members and set due dates for each task.
- **Calendar View**: Visualize all tasks in a calendar format, allowing you to see deadlines and plan accordingly.
- **Task Popup**: Manage task details, assign users, and set due dates through a convenient popup interface.
- **Notes**: Add notes to tasks to provide additional details or instructions.
- **LocalStorage Integration**: All tasks and settings are saved in `localStorage`, so your data persists even after refreshing the page.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and works seamlessly on different screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, React Router, Redux for state management, Styled Components for styling, and React DnD for drag-and-drop functionality.
- **State Management**: Redux is used to manage the application's state, ensuring a smooth and predictable user experience.
- **Styling**: Styled Components are used for styling the components, ensuring a modern and maintainable design.
- **Task Storage**: Tasks and their states are stored in `localStorage` to maintain persistence across browser sessions.

## Installation

To run TaskFlow locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/TaskFlow.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd TaskFlow
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. **Creating Tasks**: Start by adding tasks in the input field at the top. Press "Enter" to add the task to the "To Do" column.
2. **Managing Tasks**: Click on any task to open the task popup. From there, you can assign the task to a team member, set a due date, or add notes.
3. **Dragging and Dropping**: Drag tasks from one column to another to update their status.
4. **Calendar View**: Scroll down to see tasks displayed on a calendar based on their due dates. Click on a day to see the tasks due on that date.
